# Capstone-Project

> This project consists of creating almost from scratch an online shopping website based on Mohammed Awad's [ZATTIX](https://www.behance.net/gallery/24796463/ZATTIX) website. Fonts, colors and general positioning are required and content was chosen due to my love for music. There are 2 pages totally responsive for all types of viewports.
